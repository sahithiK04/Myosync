# Myosync
PROSTHETIC ARM CONTROL USING EMG SIGNALS AND MACHINE LEARNING
MyoSync - EMG-Based Prosthetic Control System

Project Overview

MyoSync is an innovative system that utilizes EMG (Electromyography) signals to control prosthetic limbs. By interpreting muscle activity, the system enables precise and real-time movement control, enhancing mobility for individuals with limb differences.

Features

EMG Signal Detection: Captures muscle activity using surface EMG sensors.

Signal Processing: Filters noise and extracts key features for accurate motion prediction.

Machine Learning Integration: Trained ML models predict intended movements with improved responsiveness.

Real-Time Control: Ensures minimal latency for smooth prosthetic movements.

User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple interface for calibration, testing, and customization.

Tech Stack

Hardware: EMG Sensors, Raspberry Pi, Servo Motors

Programming Languages: Python, C

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
